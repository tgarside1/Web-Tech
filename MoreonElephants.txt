An elephant family is ruled by a matriarch (older female), and generally consist of her female 
offspring and their young. In Africa, a basic family unit consists of six to twelve animals, but 
families of twelve to twenty elephants are quite common. An elephant family will split depending
on the size of the family, the amount of available food, and how well they are getting along. 
When the matriarch dies, one of the oldest offspring takes her place. An elephant family is led 
by a matriarch, with the matriarch being the oldest and most experienced of the herd. The matriarchal 
society consists of her female offspring and their young. In some cases it may include one of the 
matriarch's sisters and her offspring as well. It is this close contact and relationship allows 
the rest of the elephant to acquire knowledge to be used when needed.
