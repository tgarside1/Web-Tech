   <h1> Project Proposal</h1>
   <hr/>
   <h2> Proposed domain name: insideoutboston.com</h2>
   <hr/>
   <h2> Objective:</h2>
   <p> I wanted to create a website that showed a little bit of me and how I see the city I live in. This website would be a kind of blog where I post things about where I think the best places to eat are and where to go for night life and everything in between. I am hoping to use some of my own pictures and mix in a few that are not my own if need be. I was also thinking of creating a live map of the South End (where I live) and plotting some of the places I will talk about. I will have tabs for the different subjects of my blog such as food, spa, movies etc. I will then link some of my recommendations to something relevant. For example, if under the food tab, I recommended a restaraunt, I would first link to my own pictures and experience, then I could link to either their yelp review or Open Table, so the viewer could make a reservation. </p>
   
   <p> The objective of this website would be to give users an inside view of the city. My view, however, would be a little less biased because I myself just moved into the city only 3 years ago. I feel I can give some insight to people who are viisting the city or who have just moved in to the city. People want honest opinions about where the best places are to go, but almost noone gives an honest opinion. Whether it's  out of fear or because they don't want to hurt people's feelings, I am not sure. I think I could be fairly objective, giving both the good and the bad and then back it up with my own personal experiences.</p>

   <h2> Target audience: tourists, people new to the city, anyone who is visiting</h2>
